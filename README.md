This is real time number plate detector which can also be used for security purposes as it saves the photo of the number plates it detects. It needs some work when working with fast videos otherwise it just works fine.

# 2. Virtual Paint

It is a real time Painter it detects the color of pen you are using and produces pixels of that color. Of course in my example it is showing some glitch because the color values I have provided may have been wrong or it is model fault😁.


# Dependicies
- Install all of the packages listed in requirements.txt
- Place an image inside of the root direcotry called "test.png". This will be the file that which you want to be identified.
- Finallly run the the script you want to use for a particular task for eg:- `NumberPlateDector.py` for detecting number plates, so on and so forth. you get the idea right?:)

# Requiremnts
- `Python` > 3.5
- All the dependicies

# Credits
- a big thank you to `openCV` and `numpy` team members.
- a you tube video that ignited my interest😄.
